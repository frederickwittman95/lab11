## Can you think of a real-world problem that can be represented using a graph?

Yes, I can think of a real world problem that can be represented using a graph.  The concentration of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere over time could be represented as a graph; the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is connected to global temperature and is of interest to climate scientists, business leaders, and policy makers.
